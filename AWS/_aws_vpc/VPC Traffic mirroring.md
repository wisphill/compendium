VPC traffic mirroring is a feature/mechanism that allows to capture and inspect network traffic in the VPC.

The feature can be used to route traffic to the security applications for multiple purposes.
**We can capture traffic:
- from **sources eni**
- and send it to target **network eni** or and ELB.

Source and target can be in the same VPC or in the different VPC (by using VPC Peering feature).

Use cases:
- Content inspection
- Security
- Troubleshooting
