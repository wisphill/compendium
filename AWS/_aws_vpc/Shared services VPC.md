In the case we want to reduce administrative overhead and the cost while providing shared access to services requires by workloads in each of VPCs, we can use sharedservice VPC

### Specifications
- Hub-and-spoke model
- Shared services will be placed on the shared vpc.
- Sharing resource (Directory service, VPC endpoint for example) in the central location will reduce the admin workload, cost, overhead.

Compare with full-meshed VPC
- More better, cost and operational effective

Compare with transit VPC
- Transit VPC is the central VPC by using EC2 VPN instances. It is the sharing access, additional VPC layer to maintain.

Compare with VPCs connected to DX.
- Use case: All VPCs connects to the on-premise network using DX connection and taking time for setting up
